# Barbie Dress Up Minigame Concept

## Introduction
I have adopted and implemented the concept of "Barbie Dress Up" games, a very popular game among browser users, which has brought happiness to many girls during their childhood. 
## How does this game work?
* I have created a base class called "Garment," which represents a general piece of clothing, from which the entire game program originates. Each variable in the "Garment" class consists of a code and a color. 
* Using the principle of inheritance, I have created four derived classes from the "Garment" class, representing different types of clothing: "Blouse," "Dress," "Pants," and "Skirt." Each class includes:
    1. a constructor
    2. a copy constructor
3. a setter
4. a destructor
5. operator=
6. operator<<
7. operator>>. 
* Then, I created a class called "Barbie," which represents the Barbie doll itself. Through the "Barbie" class, we upgrade her physical appearance by repeatedly adding and removing various clothes.
